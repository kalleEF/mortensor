# mortensor 0.1.9000 (development of 0.2.0)

Clean break: the 0.1.x interface is replaced (see `dev/revamp-plan.md`).

* Data layer: `mt_axis` (`single_ages()`, `age_groups()`, `single_years()`,
  `parse_age_labels()`), `mt_data()` with tables at their own resolution,
  `mt_grid()`/`mt_set_grid()`, `mt_array()`, `mt_window()`,
  `mt_granularity()`, `mt_validate()` (including hierarchy sums),
  `mt_regroup()`, `mt_operator()`, `mt_as_exposure()`, `as_mt_data()` for
  data frames, `StMoMoData` and `demogdata`, and the simulated `mt_example()`.
* Native penalized composite link model and `mt_ungroup()`: deaths are
  ungrouped as rates with exposures as offset; the open interval is expanded
  to omega; 1D (default) and 2D; group totals preserved.
* `mt_smooth()` and preprocessing pipelines (`mt_prep()`, `step_*()`) that
  backtests refit on every training window.
* Interval-aware `life_table()` and `life_expectancy()` (also path by path
  on forecast draws).
* Model contract (`mt_fit()`, `mt_forecast()`, `mt_draws`) with models
  `rwd()`, `lee_carter()` (Poisson and SVD; agrees with StMoMo and
  demography), `tucker3()` (native HOOI; log and CoDa), `arima_series()`,
  `ets_series()`, and `mt_ensemble()`.
* `mt_backtest()` (rolling origin, scored at the observed resolution) and
  `mt_score()` (CRPS, WIS, coverage, PIT, MASE).
* Validation pipeline in `validation/` and GitHub workflows for R CMD check
  (R 4.3 to devel), coverage, lint and validation.
* Dependencies reduced to data.table and Matrix (plus base packages).

# mortensor 0.1.1

Maintenance release before the 0.2 rewrite (see `dev/implementation-plan.md`).

* `%||%` is imported from rlang, so the package works on R < 4.4 (review D1).
* `forecast()` and `accuracy()` are the generics from the generics package
  (re-exported); methods dispatch correctly after `library(forecast)` (D2).
* Licence changed to GPL-3.
* Undefined global variables declared; stray files removed from the repository.
* `dev/baseline/` records point forecasts of every model as a regression
  baseline for the rewrite.
